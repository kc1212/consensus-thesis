\begin{abstract}
% what's the problem?
Blockchain systems have the potential to decentralise many traditionally centralised systems.
However, scalability remains a key challenge.
Without a horizontally scalable solution, blockchain systems remain unsuitable for ubiquitous use.
% what's the solution?
We design a novel blockchain system called \textsc{Checo}.
Each node in our system maintains a personal hash chain,
which only stores transactions that the node is involved in.
A consensus is reached on special blocks called checkpoint blocks rather than on all the transactions.
Checkpoint blocks are effectively a hash pointer to the personal hash chains,
thus a single checkpoint block may represent a large set of transactions.
The consensus protocol does not imply transaction validity.
Hence we introduce a validation protocol which allows nodes to verify that the transactions are correctly recorded,
meaning that consensus on transactions is achieved indirectly via checkpoint blocks.
% how good is the solution?
We evaluate \textsc{Checo} analytically and experimentally.
Our results show a strong indication of horizontal scalability even in the worst case,
where every transaction is made with a randomly selected node.
