\begin{abstract}
% what's the problem?
Blockchain systems have the potential to decentralise many traditionally centralised systems.
However, scalability remains a key challenge.
Without a horizontally scalable solution,
where performance increases by adding more nodes to the system,
blockchain systems remain unsuitable for ubiquitous use.
% what's the solution?
We design a novel blockchain system called \textsc{Checo}.
Each node in our system maintains a personal hash chain,
which only stores transactions that the node is involved in.
A consensus is reached on special blocks called checkpoint blocks rather than on all the transactions.
Checkpoint blocks are effectively a hash pointer to the personal hash chains;
thus a single checkpoint block may represent an arbitrarily large set of transactions.
We introduce a validation protocol so that any node can check the validity of any transaction.
Since it is a point-to-point protocol, we achieve horizontal scalability.
% how good is the solution?
We analytically evaluate our system and proof a number of highly desirable correctness properties.
Further, we give a free and open-source implementation of \textsc{Checo} and evaluate it experimentally.
Our results show a strong indication of horizontal scalability.
