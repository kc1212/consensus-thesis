Since early 2013, when I mined my first Bitcoin, 
I have been interested in decentralising the traditionally centralised systems.
Following the Snowden revelations, the interest became a desire that has stayed with me ever since.
Today, many blockchain systems are mature, but still not yet ready for ubiquitous use due to the scalability limitation.
Many of us still do not use Bitcoin to purchase everyday goods, online or offline.
This limitation, as well as my personal ambitions, led me to this thesis,
with the goal of creating a truly horizontally scalable solution.
