I mined my first Bitcoin in early 2013 with a GPU.
Since then, I have been interested in decentralising the tradationally centralised systems.
Following the Snowden revelations, the interest became a burning desire.
Today, many blockchain systems are mature, but still not yet ready for ubiquitous use due to the scalability limitation.
Many of us still do not use Bitcoin to purchase everyday goods, online or offline.
This limitation as well as my personal ambitions led me to this thesis,
with the goal of creating a truely horizontally scalable solution.
