Three aspects:
checkpoints (consensus)
    for every round we need fair lottery, consistent facilitators, agreement, total order, liveness

transactions (tamperproofness)
    implicit consensus on transactions
    maintain chain structure (not possible, but we can do it probabilistically)
performance
