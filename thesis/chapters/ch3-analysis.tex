\chapter{Analysis}
\label{ch:analysis}

Up to this point we described our system specification in detail.
Of course, specification along does not establish any truths.
In this chapter, we prove two aspects of our system.
First is correctness,
where we show that the consensus protocol and the validation protocol satisfies their desired properties
(\Cref{def:consensus} and \Cref{def:validation} respectively).
The second is performance,
where we prove the lower bound of our throughput and show that it out performs classical blockchain systems.

\section{Correctness}
Our objective in this section is to establish correctness,
in particular our system should have the properties described in \Cref{def:consensus}.

We first give the proof outline.


Three aspects:
checkpoints (consensus)
    for every round we need fair lottery, consistent facilitators, agreement, total order, liveness
    for the whole thing, we need global liveness
transactions (tamperproofness)
    implicit consensus on transactions
    maintain chain structure (not possible, but we can do it probabilistically)
