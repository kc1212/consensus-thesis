  \begin{itemize}
    \item Everyone has their own chain
    \item Transactions are on arbitrary data $m$

\subsection{Consensus Protocol Overview}
\begin{frame}{Consensus Protocol Overview}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $N$ lucky nodes are selected at random to act as promoters.
    \item Every node sends CP blocks to promoters.
    \item Promoters run a BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant) consensus algorithm to
      agree on a set of CP blocks---$\mathcal{C}_r$.
    \item Disseminate $\mathcal{C}_r$.
    \item Any node can verify that their transaction is in consensus.
    \item Repeat for next round.
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{block}{Block Title}
You can also highlight sections of your presentation in a block, with it's own title

There are separate environments for theorems, examples, definitions and proofs.

Here is an example of an example block.
